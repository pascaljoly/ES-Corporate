# Energy Score Tool - Demo Scripts

## Demo Options

### Option 1: Complete Demo (2-3 minutes)
```bash
cd /path/to/EStool
source energy-compare/venv/bin/activate
python end_to_end_demo.py
```

### Option 2: Quick Demo (30 seconds)
```bash
cd /path/to/EStool
source energy-compare/venv/bin/activate
python quick_demo.py
```

## What the Demo Shows

### 1. **Model Energy Scoring**
- Scores individual ML models for energy consumption
- Shows energy (kWh), CO2 emissions (kg), throughput (samples/sec)
- Displays model size and architecture information

### 2. **Model Comparison & Ranking**
- Compares multiple models side-by-side
- Ranks models using 1-5 star rating system
- Shows clear winners and performance trade-offs

### 3. **Custom Scoring Weights**
- Demonstrates different prioritization strategies
- Energy-focused vs Performance-focused comparisons
- Shows how rankings change based on business priorities

### 4. **Configuration System**
- Shows centralized configuration management
- Demonstrates environment variable overrides
- Highlights ease of customization without code changes

### 5. **Business Value**
- Cost optimization through energy-efficient model selection
- Sustainability and CO2 emission tracking
- Real-world use cases and technical advantages

## Expected Output

The demo will show:
- ✅ Individual model scoring results
- ✅ Model comparison rankings with star ratings
- ✅ Custom weight demonstrations
